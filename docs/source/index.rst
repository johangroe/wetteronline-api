================
WetterOnline API
================

**wetteronline** is a Python library which provides unofficial access to the weatherdata hosted on `wetteronline.de <https://www.wetteronline.de>`__.
It uses webscraping and (hopefully) offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

.. note::

   This project is under active development. (And so is the documentation too!)
